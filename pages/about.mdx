<Heading>About the Game~B Library</Heading>

The aim of this library is to provide a comprehensive set of publicly available material about Game~B.

### Everything is a perspective

We are fully aware that there cannot be a "right" or "official" selection of material.
That's why our curators are *explicit*. All collections are the expression of a specific *perspective*, owned by 1 person.
Hopefully, by combining various perspectives, we can achieve parallax on what is relevant Game~B material.

### In a library do as librarians do

On this site there is *no original content*. All content is derivative. This can mean a number things:

* Imported automatically or hand-picked
* Transcribed automatically or partially or fully by hand
* Collected, categorized, tagged, quote-mined, annotated...

### Seed

We automatically collect material from various sources (youtube, medium, vimeo, individual websites...) based on this "seed", which gets extended based on what curators find relevant:
